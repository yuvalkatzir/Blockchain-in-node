## Summary

**Project Title**: Simple Cryptocurrency Blockchain In Node.js

**Overview**:
This project provides a simplified blockchain implementation in JavaScript, designed for educational purposes and basic understanding of blockchain principles. It features an easy-to-understand proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm with a lower difficulty level for quick testing.

**Features**:
- **Block Creation**: Includes basic block elements such as index, timestamp, data, and preceding hash.
- **Hashing**: Utilizes SHA-256 for block hashing.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Implements a straightforward PoW algorithm using leading zeros.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Default difficulty set for ease of testing and demonstration.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Hash Computation**: Uses SHA-256 hashing with a nonce for PoW.
- **Mining Algorithm**: Simplified PoW using a leading zeros approach to validate blocks.
- **Chain Validation**: Verifies the blockchainâ€™s integrity by checking hashes and preceding hashes.

**Usage**:
1. **Initialization**: Instantiate `CryptoBlockchain`.
2. **Add Blocks**: Use `addNewBlock` to add and mine new blocks.
3. **Check Validity**: Ensure blockchain integrity with `checkChainValidity`.

**Future Enhancements**:
- **Transition to Advanced PoW**: Consider integrating more complex PoW methods.
- **Performance Tuning**: Explore optimization techniques for mining and blockchain operations.

**Conclusion**:
This simplified version offers a basic introduction to blockchain technology and serves as a foundation for further development and exploration of more advanced blockchain concepts.
