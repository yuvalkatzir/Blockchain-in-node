# Advanced Blockchain Implementation in Node.js

## Overview

This project presents an advanced implementation of a blockchain in JavaScript, featuring realistic proof-of-work (PoW) mechanisms and higher difficulty levels. This version provides a sophisticated demonstration of blockchain technology for deeper technical exploration. For a simpler and easier-to-test version, please refer to the [simpler branch](https://github.com/yuvalkatzir/Blockchain-in-node/tree/simpler-proof-of-work).

## Features

- **Block Creation**: Incorporates index, timestamp, data, and preceding block hash.
- **Hashing**: Utilizes SHA-256 for secure hashing.
- **Proof-of-Work**: Implements a realistic PoW algorithm with adjustable difficulty.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Includes mechanisms for higher difficulty levels to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Implementation Details

- **Hash Computation**: Uses SHA-256 for hash generation and includes a nonce for PoW.
- **Mining Algorithm**: Employs an advanced PoW method with a target difficulty value.
- **Chain Validation**: Ensures blockchain integrity by verifying hashes and preceding hashes.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Create an instance of `CryptoBlockchain`.
2. **Add Blocks**: Add and mine blocks using the `addNewBlock` method.
3. **Check Validity**: Verify blockchain integrity with the `checkChainValidity` method.

## Future Enhancements

- **Further Optimization**: Improve mining efficiency and blockchain performance.
- **Feature Expansion**: Explore additional blockchain features and integrations.

## Conclusion

This advanced version showcases realistic blockchain functionality and provides a robust foundation for further exploration and development in blockchain technology.
